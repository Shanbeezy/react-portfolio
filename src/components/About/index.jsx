                Welcome to my About Page!

            <p>        
                I'm excited to share my journey with you. After spending several years managing in the service industry, I decided to transition into the world of coding. The experience in customer service taught me valuable skills such as communication, problem-solving, and attention to detail. These skills are proving to be incredibly beneficial as I navigate through learning and developing software.
