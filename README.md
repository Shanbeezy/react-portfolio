# react-portfolio

## Description
This is a place for me to share all of the projects that I have done so far in my coding experience. This specific portfolio showcases my skills using React. So take a look at it and let me know what you think.

## Installation
To install necessary dependencies you would have to implement npm install
Then run the build, npm run build
Then to start the server, you would input node run start

## Roadmap
My ideas for future releases would be to updat this with new projects as well as new styling and technologies to further my coding experience and test my growth. So this portfolio will grow as I do in the development world. If you have any questions or would like to tell me how I did, feel free to email me at jay.are.sj@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you.
